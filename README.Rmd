## Overview

`cytometree` is a package which performs automatic gating and annotation of flow-cytometry
data. On top of the [CRAN help files](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cytometree/cytometree.pdf), 
we also provide a [vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cytometree/vignettes/autogating_cytometree.html)
illustrating the functionnalities of `cytometree`.

The following article explains what `cytometree` is about:
