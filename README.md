## Overview

`cytometree` is a package which performs automatic gating and annotation

also provide a
[vignette](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/cytometree/vignettes/autogating_cytometree.html)
illustrating the functionnalities of `cytometree`.

The following article explains what `cytometree` is about:
